It's a Checkpoint System, but worse.

Have the game Auto Save after a user defined amount of completed missions. The save will overwrite any other saves including user, mod, or mission saves so you can get stuck in a cycle of reloading and dying, refund requests will be ignored. Currently no user settings due to lack of code to steal, currently set to auto save when 2 missions are completed or 5 minutes have passed and no warning will be shown.
